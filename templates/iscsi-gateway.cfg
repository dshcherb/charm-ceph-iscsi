# # API settings.
# # The API supports a number of options that allow you to tailor it to your
# # local environment. If you want to run the API under https, you will need to
# # create cert/key files that are compatible for each iSCSI gateway node, that is
# # not locked to a specific node. SSL cert and key files *must* be called
# # 'iscsi-gateway.crt' and 'iscsi-gateway.key' and placed in the '/etc/ceph/' directory
# # on *each* gateway node. With the SSL files in place, you can use 'api_secure = true'
# # to switch to https mode.
#
# # To support the API, the bear minimum settings are:
api_secure = {{ certificates.enable_tls }}
api_user = admin
api_password = {{ cluster.admin_password }}
api_port = 5000
trusted_ip_list = {{ cluster.gw_hosts }}
